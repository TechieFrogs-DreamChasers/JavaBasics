Few things you should take care:

Do not mix primitives and objects while doing comparisons. 
You might get unpredictable results for such comparisons. 
Better thing to do is: compare object with objects (using equals() method) and 
compare primitive with primitives(using logical operators such as “==”, “<” etc).
